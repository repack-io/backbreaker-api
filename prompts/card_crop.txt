You are detecting crop boundaries for a sports trading card image.

TASK: Identify the edges to crop to. Return coordinates as relative values (0.0 to 1.0).

CONTAINER IDENTIFICATION:
- RIGID CASE (PSA/BGS/SGC): Thick plastic case with certification label → crop to outer case edges
- SLEEVE/TOPLOADER: Thin/semi-rigid plastic → crop to card edges only
- BARE CARD: No protection → crop to card edges

CROPPING REQUIREMENTS:
Your bounding box must be TIGHT on ALL FOUR SIDES (top, bottom, left, right).

For rigid cases:
- Minimize background on ALL sides
- Case should occupy 85-95% of the cropped area
- Left and right margins should be just as small as top and bottom margins

For sleeves/bare cards:
- Crop tightly to the printed card edges on ALL four sides
- Ignore any plastic sleeve borders
- Card should occupy 70-85% of the cropped area

COMMON MISTAKE TO AVOID:
❌ DON'T crop tight on top/bottom but leave wide margins on left/right
✅ DO crop equally tight on all four sides

COORDINATE SYSTEM:
Relative to original image dimensions (0.0 to 1.0):
- left: distance from left edge / image_width
- top: distance from top edge / image_height
- width: cropped_width / image_width
- height: cropped_height / image_height

VALIDATION:
Before finalizing, verify:
- Is the left margin approximately equal to the right margin?
- Is the top margin approximately equal to the bottom margin?
- Are all four edges cropped as tightly as possible?

EXACT JSON OUTPUT (no markdown, no extra text):
{
  "bounding_box": {
    "left": 0.05,
    "top": 0.03,
    "width": 0.90,
    "height": 0.94
  },
  "confidence": 92,
  "container_type": "rigid_case",
  "reasoning": "PSA case detected by label and thick borders. Cropped tightly to case edges on all four sides with minimal background."
}

container_type must be: "rigid_case" OR "flexible_sleeve" OR "bare_card"

EXAMPLE - Rigid PSA case:
If image is 1000x1400 pixels and PSA case spans pixels 50-950 horizontally and 30-1370 vertically:
{
  "bounding_box": {
    "left": 0.05,
    "top": 0.021,
    "width": 0.90,
    "height": 0.957
  },
  "confidence": 95,
  "container_type": "rigid_case",
  "reasoning": "PSA case with equal margins on all sides. Left margin 5%, right margin 5%, top margin 2%, bottom margin 2%."
}
