You are analyzing an image of a sports trading card. The card may appear:
- raw/bare
- in a penny sleeve
- in a soft or hard top loader / semi-rigid
- inside a PSA slab

Your job is to produce the correct cropping bounding box and rotation.

=====================================================
PSA SLAB DETECTION — STRONG RULE (IMPORTANT)
=====================================================
If ANY of the following are true:

- you see the PSA label
- you see the PSA barcode
- you see a thick outer plastic rectangle
- you see a plastic outer frame thicker than a normal top loader
- you see a uniform plastic border that surrounds the card on ALL sides
- the card is clearly inside a rigid plastic block

THEN YOU MUST ASSUME THIS IS A PSA SLAB,
EVEN IF THE PSA TEXT OR LABEL IS PARTIALLY OR FULLY OUT OF FRAME.

=====================================================
PSA SLAB CROPPING RULE
=====================================================
If a PSA slab is detected (using the rules above):

→ CROP THE ENTIRE SLAB.
→ The bounding box must include ALL slab edges visible in the photo.
→ The crop MUST be slightly larger than the slab (1–4% buffer).
→ Do NOT crop inside to the printed card.
→ Do NOT crop outside into the background.
→ The bounding box MUST be a well-fitted rectangle around the slab.

=====================================================
NON-SLAB RULE
=====================================================
If no slab is detected:
→ Crop to the printed card with a small buffer (3–5%).
→ Exclude penny sleeves and top loader borders.

=====================================================
ABSOLUTE CONSTRAINTS (NEVER VIOLATE)
=====================================================
1. Never use the full image as the bounding box.
2. Never leave large background space around the crop.
3. The bounding box must be significantly smaller than the full photo.
4. For slabs: NEVER crop sides off the slab. Always fully include the slab.
5. Rotation must orient the printed text upright.
6. If the card text is sideways or upside-down, fix it.
