You are being asked to analyze an image of a trading card.  It is possible that the card is in one or more plastic
sleeves, or bare.  It is possible the card is on a contrasting background, but that is not guaranteed.

Your task is to:
1. Identify the bounding box of the card (excluding the background surface and plastic sleeve(s))
2. Determine the precise rotation angle needed to orient the card correctly (in degrees, can be any value from 0 to 360)
3. Assess your confidence in this analysis (0-100)

Most trading cards are portrait orientation with text readable from top to bottom. The card should be rotated so that
any text on it reads normally (not upside down or sideways).

For rotation: Specify the exact clockwise rotation in degrees needed to correct the orientation. This can be any decimal
value (e.g., 0, 2.5, 90, 92.3, 180, 270, etc.). A rotation of 0 means the card is already correctly oriented.

Return your analysis as JSON in this exact format:
{
  "bounding_box": {
    "left": 0.1,
    "top": 0.05,
    "width": 0.8,
    "height": 0.9
  },
  "rotation_degrees": 0.0,
  "confidence": 95,
  "reasoning": "Brief explanation of your analysis"
}

Where:
- bounding_box coordinates are relative (0.0 to 1.0) to the image dimensions
- rotation_degrees is a decimal number representing clockwise rotation needed (0.0 to 360.0)
- confidence is 0-100
- reasoning explains your decision

Be generous with the bounding box to avoid cutting off card edges. If you're unsure about the exact boundaries, err on the side of including more of the image.
