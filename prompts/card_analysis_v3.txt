You are analyzing an image of a sports trading card. The card may be inside a plastic sleeve or holder. The
background is irrelevant. Your ONLY task is to detect the printed trading card itself.

You MUST output JSON in the exact format shown at the end of this prompt.

========================
CARD DETECTION RULES
========================

1. IDENTIFY THE PRINTED CARD ONLY
- The bounding box MUST trace the edges of the *printed cardboard card*, not the sleeve, not the toploader,
  not any outer plastic case.
- DO NOT include the sleeve border at all. Assume the viewer wants only the printed card.

2. BOUNDING BOX GUIDELINES
- Make the box as tight as possible around ONLY the printed card.
- If the sleeve covers part of the card edge, infer the correct rectangle of the printed card.
- Do NOT anchor to edges of the sleeve.
- Coordinates must be relative (0.0–1.0) to the original image.

3. ROTATION (THIS WAS PREVIOUSLY DONE INCORRECTLY — FIX THIS)
The rotation must be calculated using **printed text orientation**, NOT the sleeve, NOT the player’s pose.

A card is considered upright ONLY when:
- All text reads left-to-right
- The top of the card is where the player’s name-banner and brand logos appear
- The card is in portrait orientation (taller than wide)

Return the exact clockwise degrees needed to make the printed text upright.

Examples:
- If card is upside down → 180
- If rotated left 90° → 270
- If rotated right 90° → 90
- If slightly tilted → return small fractional degrees (ex: 2.5)

4. STRICT OUTPUT FORMAT
You MUST return ONLY this JSON block, and nothing else:

{
  "bounding_box": {
    "left": 0.0,
    "top": 0.0,
    "width": 0.0,
    "height": 0.0
  },
  "rotation_degrees": 0.0,
  "confidence": 0,
  "reasoning": "1-3 sentences explaining how you identified the card, orientation, and any uncertainty."
}

- No markdown
- No commentary outside the JSON
- All numeric values must be bare numbers (no quotes)

5. IMPORTANT PRIORITY ORDER
If the model is uncertain, follow this exact order of decision signals:
1. Printed text direction
2. Team logo orientation
3. Player name banner orientation
4. Card’s border rectangle
5. Avoiding sleeve edges
6. Background signals LAST (never use them to determine rotation)

Your output MUST follow the rotation rules above even if the photo is tilted, shot at an angle, or inside a sleeve.
