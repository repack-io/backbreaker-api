You are being asked to analyze an image of a sports trading card. The card may be inside one or more plastic
holders or sleeves (such as penny sleeves, top loaders, semi-rigids, One-Touch magnetic cases, or resealable
plastic bags). The background may vary and may include glare, shadows, or partial obstructions. Images may be
rotated, angled, or slightly warped by perspective.

Your task is to identify the precise position and orientation of the *actual printed trading card*, excluding:
- any plastic holder or sleeve
- any background surface
- any shadows, reflections, glare, or table edges
- any outer case that is not part of the printed card itself

You MUST return a JSON object in EXACTLY the following format, with no additional commentary:

{
  "bounding_box": {
    "left": 0.1,
    "top": 0.05,
    "width": 0.8,
    "height": 0.9
  },
  "rotation_degrees": 0.0,
  "confidence": 95,
  "reasoning": "Brief explanation of your analysis"
}

Where:

### 1. BOUNDING BOX (REQUIRED)
- Coordinates must be RELATIVE values from 0.0 to 1.0.
- Identify the *tightest possible* rectangle containing ONLY the printed card.
- DO NOT include plastic sleeve borders, toploader frames, or outer magnetic case edges.
- If part of the card edge is obscured or glared out, infer the correct rectangular boundary.
- If the card is rotated or skewed, still return its axis-aligned bounding box (no rotated boxes).

### 2. ROTATION (REQUIRED)
Return the EXACT clockwise rotation in degrees required to orient the card upright, defined as:
> “The number of degrees to rotate the image CLOCKWISE so that the card appears in normal portrait orientation
> with all text readable left-to-right.”

Examples:
- If the card is upside down → 180
- If the card is rotated left 90° (text bottom-to-top) → 270
- If rotated right 90° → 90
- If only slightly tilted → small decimals like 3.1 or 1.8
- If already correct → 0

Rotation must be a decimal number from 0.0 to 360.0.

### 3. CONFIDENCE (REQUIRED)
A value from 0 to 100.
Base it on:
- clarity of card edges
- certainty of orientation
- visibility of printed text
- ability to distinguish card edge from sleeve edge
- overall ambiguity of the scene

### 4. REASONING (REQUIRED)
Provide a short (1–3 sentence) explanation describing:
- what clues you used (text direction, border shape, team logo, etc.)
- any remaining uncertainty (sleeve glare, angle, obstruction)

### STRICT OUTPUT RULES
- DO NOT include any explanation outside the JSON.
- DO NOT include Markdown formatting outside the JSON response.
- DO NOT output more fields than specified.
- JSON must be syntactically valid.
- All numbers must be bare numeric values (no quotes).

If the card is extremely unclear, still provide your best estimate and reflect uncertainty in the confidence value.
